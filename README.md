# MaterialComponents
## 1. Depend on our library

* Add a single Gradle dependency to your app/module ```build.gradle``` file:

  ```implementation "com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0"```

## 2. New Namespace and AndroidX

If your app currently depends on the original Design Support Library, you can make use of the Refactor to AndroidXâ€¦ option provided by Android Studio. Doing so will update your app's dependencies and code to use the newly packaged androidx and com.google.android.material libraries.

With Android Studio 3.2 and higher, you can quickly migrate an existing project to use AndroidX by selecting **Refactor > Migrate** to AndroidX from the menu bar.

If you don't want to switch over to the new androidx and com.google.android.material packages yet, you can use Material Components via the com.android.support:design:28.0.0 dependency.

## 3. Change your app theme to inherit from a Material Components theme

Update your app theme to inherit from one of these themes, e.g.:

  ```xml
  <style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight">
      <!-- ... -->
  </style> 
  ```

If you cannot change your theme to inherit from a Material Components theme, you can inherit from a Material Components Bridge theme.

  ```xml
  <style name="Theme.MyApp" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.Bridge">
      <!-- ... -->
  </style> 
  ```
